Dev Club IIT Delhi.
This is the club which fantasize me much.Apart from coding we get exposure to most of the development area being it html,css,gits,android development etc.
I personally feel more incline towards app development and i know through this club I am going to accomplish that.
Their continuous assignment will make me more engaged in the development work.
In the orientation only they told us that Google and Stackoverflow are gonna be your best friend for your upcoming years and yes it is so true.
In doing my first assignment i got many help from them apart from the tutorial links provided in the assignment.
In this club our seniors are very much helpful.I missed few lectures of this club like android development,gits linux etc but i got help from the seniors regarding that.
And the club uploads its lecture too which is quite helpful.
In the orientation one of the senior showed that he made an app through which we can do some option like play,pause a video etc using my mobile phone.
In my upcoming journey I'm surely gonna learn very much about development.
Thank U.
